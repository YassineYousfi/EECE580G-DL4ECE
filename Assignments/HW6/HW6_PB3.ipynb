The pretrained BigGAN is available for download from tf_hub.\n","\n","The downloaded object is not a tf.keras.Model but a tf.function, we will treat it as a black-box function.\n","\n","1.  Use the provided code to download the BigGAN generator and list the inputs of the function. Explain what each input is.\n","\n","2.  Complete the code under the section \"consistency in z space.\" We wish to generate one sample of a white wolf and one sample of a grey wolf using the same random vector `z`. You can find the class indices here: https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a. You need to one-hot encode the `y` argument (use `tf.onehot`, and remember how many classes does ImageNet has).\n","\n","3.  What is the range of the generated samples (minimum, maximum value)? How to rescale them back to natural images? Write a function `rescale_samples(samples)` to do that.\n","\n","4.  Comment on the generated samples.\n","\n","5.  Create a function `interpolate_line(z_1, z_1, num_steps)` which returns a tf.Tensor `T` of shape `(num_steps, 128)` where the rows of the returned tensor correspond to vectors in the linear interpolation between `z_1` and `z_2` i.e. `T[0] = z_1, ..., T[-1] = z_2`\n","\n","6.  Complete the code under the section \"Linear interpolation\" to generate a \"linear walk\" between two generated images of a tibetan terrier using `num_steps=16`\n","\n","7.  Comment on the smoothness of the transitions."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b3j09q7sv0hj"},"source":["import tensorflow_hub as hub\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","#import logging\n","#logging.getLogger('tensorflow').setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import time"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PiG0lgHMdQ9F"},"source":["# This line introduces a lot of warnings from TF, you can clear the output of the cell (right click - clear output)\n","module = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-512/2').signatures['default'] # takes a couple minutes"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I1lt8_MfsLfL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605749903174,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":386,"user":{"displayName":"Yassine Yousfi","photoUrl":"","userId":"06317191099946336363"}},"outputId":"93498f3d-e8c5-45f6-f001-0244b2c2ebcb"},"source":["# inputs of the tf.function `module`\n","[input for input in module.inputs if not input.dtype == tf.resource]\n","# 1. \n","# Explain what each input is"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[<tf.Tensor 'y:0' shape=(None, 1000) dtype=float32>,\n"," <tf.Tensor 'z:0' shape=(None, 128) dtype=float32>,\n"," <tf.Tensor 'truncation:0' shape=() dtype=float32>]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lhtmuYWglTlN"},"source":["## Consistency in z space"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Kdu8bLNikRxU"},"source":["truncation = 0.5  \n","tf.random.set_seed(seed=2020)\n","z = truncation * tf.random.truncated_normal([128])\n","z = tf.stack([z,z])\n","\n","# 2.\n","# YOUR CODE HERE\n","# y_idx = \n","# y = tf.onehot(...\n","\n","samples = module(y=y, z=z, truncation=tf.constant(truncation))  # Takes ~ 30 sec\n","samples = samples['default'] # module return a dictionary"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KIivSfWgpNx1"},"source":["# 3.\n","# YOUR CODE HERE\n","# range of samples?"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pTGAJdLPN4X_"},"source":["# 3.\n","def rescale_samples(samples):\n","  # YOUR CODE HERE\n","  return "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"67_jtflikvum"},"source":["rescaled_samples = rescale_samples(samples)\n","for i in range(len(rescaled_samples)):\n","  plt.imshow(rescaled_samples[i])\n","  plt.show()\n","\n","# 4.
