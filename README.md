# EECE580G-DL4ECE

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I hear that you are learning Deep Learning! That's amazing!

This is a selection of resources from Binghamton University's EECE580G - Deep Learning for ECE course.

Resources and teaching by Yassine Yousfi (me) Jan Butora and Prof. Jessica Fridrich.

This is far from being a complete guide to Deep Learning. In fact this repo only has a subset of the materials, the "cool" stuff that you cannot find in most DL courses.

For a more complete course, I encourage you to check:
